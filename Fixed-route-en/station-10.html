  <div class="intro-text">
    <p class="intro-line">The library's central courtyard features a dreamy "Magic Forest," symbolizing the roots of wisdom and the continuation of knowledge.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Wood is the raw material for paper, and this forest reminds us to "remember the source," cherishing the origin of every book.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">More deeply, it connects two graduation requirements for Yuan Ze students: the TOEIC area and the Classic Fifty collection. These books are centralized here to cultivate humanities literacy, independent thinking, and foreign language skills.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Additionally, this area serves as a stage for students to showcase aesthetic creativity. Through the fusion of art and books, reading becomes not only knowledge absorption but also an experience of beauty in daily life.</p>
