    <p class="intro-line">The AI-powered iRead Wall, launched in December 2018, is an innovative facility designed to promote eBook reading. It’s more than just a book wall—it’s a passionate reading guide powered by technology. It features three major functions: themed eBook promotions, QR code downloads, and interactive face-recognition recommendations.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Visitors can browse curated book lists on a touchscreen based on their interests or simply scan a QR code to instantly borrow eBooks.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">The most engaging feature is the “Photo Book Recommendation,” which uses facial recognition to suggest personalized book selections. On its launch day, then-President Chih-Yang Wu personally tried the feature and picked *Life Is Like a Storybook* as his winter reading choice. This inspired the library to initiate a “One Person, One Book for Winter Break” reading campaign.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">This digital book wall is not only a gateway to digital reading, but also a popular photo spot loved by students and visitors alike.</p>
