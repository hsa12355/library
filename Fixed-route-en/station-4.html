    <p class="intro-line">This area is like a digital hub for modern learning. Dozens of computer workstations are available for students and faculty to log in using their Portal credentials, enabling access to online research, video streaming, report writing, and printing.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Standing computers are also available throughout the library for visitors to search the catalog without needing an account or password.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Printing and copying services use EasyCard for payment. Users can set a print password from the computer and enter it at the machine to retrieve their documents.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">The library features 10 digital study rooms and 8 study pods, which can be reserved online or in person at the service desk.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Study rooms accommodate 3 to 8 people and are great for group discussions and watching videos. Study pods are designed for 1 to 2 people and are ideal for livestreaming, recording, video conferencing, language practice, and multimedia use.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">These flexible and diverse learning spaces are a favorite self-study haven for many students.</p>
