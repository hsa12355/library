    <p class="intro-line">Launched in December 2018, this AI-powered eBook Wall is an innovative facility designed to promote eBook reading. More than just a wall, it acts as a passionate reading guide, integrating modern technology with three main functions: themed eBook promotion, QR code download, and fun AI-based book recommendations via facial recognition.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">Visitors can explore eBook lists directly on the touchscreen or scan a QR code to instantly borrow and read on their own devices.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">The most intriguing feature is the “photo-based recommendation” function. Using facial recognition technology, the wall suggests personalized books for readers. On launch day in 2018, then-President Chih-Yang Wu personally tried this function and chose *Life Is Like a Storybook* as his winter reading, inspiring the library’s “One Book for Winter” campaign.</p>
    <p class="intro-line">This eBook Wall is not only a gateway to digital reading but also a favorite photo spot for students and visitors alike.</p>
